# Code Explanation

This code selects an SMPP connection and sets up some rules for sending messages.

## What it does:

1. **Picks the first SMPP connection**  
   ```javascript
   const smppConnection = smppConnections[0];
   ```
   This line takes the first SMPP connection from an array called smppConnections and assigns it to a constant variable smppConnection

2. **The return statement returns an object with three properties** 
   ```javascript
   return {
    smppConnections: [smppConnection],
    passToNextSmtpIfFail: false,
    sendViaWhatsappIfFail: true
   }
   ### Configuration Breakdown

| Property                 | Value      | Description |
|--------------------------|------------|-------------|
| **`smppConnections`**    | `[smppConnection]` | Creates a new array containing only the first SMPP connection that was selected |
| **`passToNextSmtpIfFail`** | `false`    | When enabled (`true`), the system will try the next SMTP server if sending fails. Here, it's **disabled** (`false`). |
| **`sendViaWhatsappIfFail`** | `true`    | Fallback option: If SMPP sending fails, the system will automatically attempt to send via **WhatsApp**. |

#### Flow Explanation:
1. Uses **only the primary SMPP connection**  
2. **No SMTP fallback** (email servers won't be tried)  
3. **WhatsApp becomes the backup** channel if SMS fails
