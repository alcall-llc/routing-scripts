# Code Explanation

This code selects an SMPP connection and sets up some rules for sending messages.

## What it does:

1. **Picks the first SMPP connection**  
   ```javascript
   const smppConnection = smppConnections[0];return {
   #Takes the first connection from a list of available SMPP connections
    smppConnections: [smppConnection], # smppConnections: Uses only that first connection we picked
    passToNextSmtpIfFail: false, # passToNextSmtpIfFail: false: If sending fails, don't try another email server
    sendViaWhatsappIfFail: true # sendViaWhatsappIfFail: true: If sending fails, try WhatsApp instead
  }
   ```
